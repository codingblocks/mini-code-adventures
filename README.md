# Mini Code Adventure: Making a Website with Yeoman

Welcome to the first Mini Code Adventure, a series of videos, posts, and projects that emphasize fun and exploration in programming.

You can use this project as a jumping off point for your own website, or couple it with other technologies to build the next hot app.

You can find the commands we wrote to get here on the blog:
